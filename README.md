# Pomo
A more fully fledged Pomodoro timer, contained completely on the command line. Tested using a _GNOME_ terminal.  

_Features:_

- All settings configurable without leaving the application  
- Shell script for convenient starting of application  
- **(YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED)** View your statistics on a myriad of time settings  

_Dependencies:_  
- `pygame`; install with `pip3 install pygame`  

_First time run:_  
1. Make sure that you have the dependencies installed!  
2. `git clone https://github.com/ItsPax/Pomo` to get the source code for the application.  
3. Navigate to the directory.   
4. `./start` to start the application.  


_To do:_  
- Implement some user interface to change the configs in `config.txt` without the user having to manually edit `config.txt`
